# STOP_BAD_FILES
This project proposed by an exercise teacher Implementation of Operating Systems that aims to put into practice what I learned about 
the use of threads , executors, and Hibernate scheduled tasks, Samba, and LDAP.

The application allows you to analyze , using Clamav , files uploaded by users to a shared resource provided by Samba and which are 
authenticated using an LDAP server.
